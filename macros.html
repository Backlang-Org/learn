<h1 id="macros">Macros</h1>
<p>A macro is a function which is called at compile time and replaces the macro-call with a new sub-tree.
Macros can match different properties of the tree. A macro call can look like integrated language constructs to hide complextity from the caller.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of how macros can be called:</p>
<pre><code class="language-back">quote(hello);

quote {
    hello;
}

quote(simplyfy) {
    hello;
}

quote;
</code></pre>
<p>If a macro is called with a block the block will be treated as the last argument. If no arguments are specified the parentheses can be left out.</p>
<p>Macros can be used to generate object graphs from resources such as files, to generate boilerplate code for design patterns, or as a simple domain specific language.</p>
