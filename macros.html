<h1 id="macros">Macros</h1>
<p>A Macro is a function which is called at compile time and replaces the macro-call with a new sub-tree.
Macros can match different properties of the tree. A macro call can look like integrated language constructs to hide complextity from the callee.</p>
<p>Here are some examples how macros can be called:</p>
<pre><code class="language-back">quote(hello);

quote {
    hello;
}

quote(simplyfy) {
    hello;
}

quote;
</code></pre>
<p>If a macro is called with a block the block will be treated as last argument. If no arguments are specified the parenthesis can be leaved out.</p>
<p>Macros can be used to generate object graphs from resources like files, generate boilterplate code for design patterns or can be used as simple domain specific language.</p>
