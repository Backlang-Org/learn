# Mixins

Mixins are versatile constructs in programming that allow for elegant extensions and modifications of classes and methods. They provide a way to dynamically add functionality without affecting the inheritance hierarchy.

Functions and Applications of Mixins

Mixins can:

* Generate class member functions
* Implement interfaces
* Add metadata
* Flexibly adjust the structure and behavior of classes

## Practical Use of Mixins

Integrating a mixin is done using the includes keyword. Consider the following example:

```sc
public class Point
    includes Equality, Hashing
{
    public prop X: i32;
    public prop Y: i32;
}
```

This code creates a class that implements the IComparable interface, automatically generating equality and inequality operators, as well as overriding the GetHashCode method. Enhanced Mixin Functionality with Arguments Mixins can also be defined with arguments to further specify their behavior:

```sc
public class Point
    includes Serialize(ignore_fields: true)
{
    public prop X: i32;
    public prop Y: i32;
}
```

In this case, Serialize and Deserialize functions are generated that only consider the properties of the class. By utilizing mixins, you can create more efficient code, enhance reusability, and flexibly extend class functionality.
