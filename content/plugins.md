# Plugins

A plugin can extend the compiler, for example by adding a new backend to compile to. The [Bs2K](/learn/plugins/bs2k) is a sample backend plugin.

To install plugins through the manager: `backlang plugins -i Backlang.Backends.Bs2k`

The manager can search for all available plugins: `backlang plugins -a`
