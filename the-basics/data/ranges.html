<h2 id="ranges">Ranges</h2>
<p>A range represents a range of numbers or in some contexts a range of types. A range has a lower and a upper bound.</p>
<pre><code class="language-back"><span class="token keyword">let</span> range = <span class="token number">1</span>..<span class="token number">200</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>The sample above uses a range from 1 to 200 inclusive. That means an array will be instanciatet with all the values from 1 to 200.</p>
