In this section you will learn the absolute basic knowledge needed to write simple applications with Backlang.

To write something out to the console:

```back
public static func main() {
    print("Hello World");
}
```

... or a shorter alternative using the main macro:

```back
main {
    print("hello world");
}
```

A program has to have an entry point method called `main`.
